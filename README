# Coral Reef Label Transfering Project

The goal of this project is to transfer labels from the 2D annotations
on the mosaiced images to the corresponding 3D pointcloud. The current
plan is to oversegment the mosaic into small superpixels, each with a
homogenous classification label, and match them to superpixels found
in the source imagery used to create the mosaic and 3D model. Then,
we can use PhotoScan to transfer the label masks onto the pointcloud.

Currently, it it reporting ~80% accuracy for transfering superpixel
labels, and the pointcloud annotation has not yet been implemented.
